## 💡 Code Examples

### 📌 1. Sticky Navigation Header with Gradient Logo

```html
<header class="sticky-header">
  <nav class="navbar">
    <a href="https://neo-athelios.github.io/WebDash/" class="logo">
      <img src="logo.png" alt="TechnixCRM Logo">
      <span class="logo-text"><pre> Technix - CRM </pre></span>
    </a>
    <ul class="nav-links">
      <li><a href="#home" class="active">Home</a></li>
      <li><a href="#features">Features</a></li>
      <li><a href="#contact">Contact</a></li>
      <li><a href="#footer">Quick Links</a></li>
      <li><a href="http://app.technixcrm.com/login" class="btn-primary">Login</a></li>
    </ul>
  </nav>
</header>
```

📘 *Explanation:*  
This code creates a **sticky header** with a branded logo and navigation menu. The `sticky-header` class ensures it stays on top while scrolling. The `btn-primary` class styles the login button.

---

### 📌 2. Hero Section with CTA Buttons

```html
<section id="home" class="hero">
  <h1><span class="highlight">The Foundation for Building and Retaining Customer Relationships</span></h1>
  <p>Generate leads, track prospects, avail opportunities, close deals and retain clients...</p>
  <img src="https://technixcrm.com/assets/images/banner-img.gif" alt="CRM Banner">
</section>
```

📘 *Explanation:*  
This section forms the **main hero area**, including a headline, subtext, and animated banner. The `highlight` class uses a text gradient to draw attention.

---

### 📌 3. Glassmorphism Slider for Features

```html
<div class="slider-container">
  <div class="slider">
    <div class="slide slide-1">
      <div class="glass-card">
        <h2>Increase Sales</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Target new customers</li>
          <li>Improve conversion rate</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
    </div>
    <!-- More slides -->
  </div>
</div>
```

📘 *Explanation:*  
This is a **glass-style sliding component** that shows key selling points in visually engaging panels. Each `slide` uses a linear gradient background with blur effects from `.glass-card`.

---

### 📌 4. CRM Feature Cards Grid

```html
<div class="features-grid">
  <div class="feature-card">
    <div class="feature-icon">📈</div>
    <h3>Lead Capture</h3>
    <p>Automatically gather and organize leads from various channels...</p>
  </div>
  <!-- More feature cards -->
</div>
```

📘 *Explanation:*  
This is a **responsive grid** of feature cards. Each card uses a box-shadow and icon header, perfect for explaining key modules like lead capture, task management, or payment tracking.

---

### 📌 5. Call-to-Action Buttons (Floating)

```html
<div class="below-header-buttons">
  <a href="#" class="btn btn-primary">Book a Demo</a>
  <a href="#" class="btn btn-outline">Free Trial</a>
</div>
```

📘 *Explanation:*  
These are **floating CTA buttons** that stay right below the navbar. The `btn-primary` is solid blue, and `btn-outline` has a bordered, subtle design.
